# BellyButton Biodiversity
The goal of this analysis was to help the company Improbable Beef identify test subjects to generate beef from bacteria grown in bellybuttons.  This project consisted of parsing through the company's volunteer test subject data and displaying the data into an interactive dashboard.  The dashboard consists of the three interactive charts listed below:
* A bar chart that illustrates the top 10 bacterial species that are grown in the volunteer'ss bellybutton.
* A bubble chart showing the amount of bacteria cultures per sample.
* A gauge chart showing how many times a volunteer washes his/her bellybutton per week.

By choosing the volunteer's identification number from the dropdown menu, the dashboard will show the volunteer's demographics, as well as the data from the three charts.  If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is grown in their navel.
